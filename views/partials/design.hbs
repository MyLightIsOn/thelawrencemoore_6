            <p>Over the years I have used many different methods and tools to create a solid foundation upon with to build. Here are some examples.</p>

What we DID know was that it had to let users sign in and manage “sites” that they could build with tiles. There was also talk of implementing QR codes that would link to the site. With just that to go on, we started off creating use cases and primary noun architecture to workout what the admin section would need. This would be the basis of our design. After several thousand ideation meetings, we created a task flow that gave us and the stakeholder a better idea of what was needed and missing.</p>

The obvious business goal is to display her writing talents, but there’s much more specific details involved in that. She needs to show particular writing skills and examples. She is also prefers traditional methods of writing, but that’s an aesthetic thing that will come in the visual design itself. We created this list of requirements.</p>

                                    <p>To display the diversity in her writing samples, I collected them all together and determined that they fell into 3 categories: Writing samples online as downloadable files (Downloads), Articles on external websites (External), and Newsletter emails (Internal). I deemed the Newsletters internal because I felt that it was best to just recreate them with HTML as opposed to taking a screen shot.  The accordion method lets the user see potentially many samples, but also giving them the option to hide them.                     </p>

                                    <p>After tweaking the wireframes a bit, I then started on the branding. Green was required so that was easy. Since Amy is a writing traditionalist, the obvious choice was to include something involving typewriters. I created the logo to resemble a typewriter key and included one on the logo itself.  I wanted the background to also be representative, just not too distracting so I placed a light black overlay on top of it.  This is the finished design.
