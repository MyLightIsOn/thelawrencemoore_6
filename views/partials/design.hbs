            <p>Over the years I have used many different methods and tools to create a solid foundation upon with to build. Here are some examples.</p>

                <p>Since I wanted to put up great examples of my design process, I figured why not start with explaining how I came up with this site? I redo my personal portfolio every year or so and this would be the 5th iteration. </p>
